# Devops

Q1. (15 Marks) 
Create a new Git repository locally, add a Java file (HelloWorld.java), commit it, and push it to 
your GitHub repository. 
Expected Output: Code and commit visible on GitHub.

# Quick plan (what you'll do)

1. Create a GitHub repository on the web.
2. On your college PC create a local folder, add `HelloWorld.java`.
3. Initialize Git, make your first commit.
4. Add the GitHub repo as a remote and push the commit.
5. Verify code/commit on GitHub.


# 0) Prerequisites

Make sure:

* Git is installed. Check with:

```bash
git --version
```

* You have a GitHub account and can log in from the browser.
* If on Windows: use Git Bash or PowerShell (Git Bash is easiest).
* If your college PC blocks SSH, use HTTPS.

---

# 1) Create the repository on GitHub (in your browser)

1. Log into github.com.
2. Click **+** ‚Üí **New repository**.
3. Fill:

   * Repository name: e.g. `hello-java`
   * Description: optional
   * **Public** or **Private** as required by your instructor
   * **Do not** initialize with README (we will push an existing repo). (If you do initialize it, commands differ slightly ‚Äî see note below.)
4. Click **Create repository**.

After creation GitHub will show you the repo page and give you commands for pushing an existing repo ‚Äî keep that page open.

---

# 2) Create project folder and HelloWorld.java (on the college PC)

Open terminal (Git Bash / Linux terminal / macOS Terminal / PowerShell):

```bash
# choose a folder, e.g. your home or Desktop
cd ~
mkdir hello-java
cd hello-java
```

Create `HelloWorld.java` (you can use `nano`, `vim`, or a text editor):

```bash
cat > HelloWorld.java <<'EOF'
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
EOF
```

Check file:

```bash
ls -l
cat HelloWorld.java
```

You should see the file content printed.

---

# 3) Initialize Git locally, set user (one-time per machine)

If you haven‚Äôt set your name/email on this machine:

```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

Initialize repo and create first commit:

```bash
git init
git add HelloWorld.java
git status              # shows staged file
git commit -m "Add HelloWorld.java"
```

Expected `git commit` output: something like

```
[master (root-commit) a1b2c3d] Add HelloWorld.java
 1 file changed, 10 insertions(+)
 create mode 100644 HelloWorld.java
```

> Note: Git may name the default branch `master`. Some systems use `main`. We'll ensure branch is `main` below (recommended).

Make branch `main` (recommended):

```bash
git branch -M main
```

---

# 4A) Push via HTTPS (if you prefer username/password or Personal Access Token)

On the GitHub repo page you copied earlier, GitHub shows commands such as:

```bash
# example (replace the URL with yours)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/hello-java.git
git push -u origin main
```

Run those commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/hello-java.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Authentication:**

* If asked for username/password:

  * If you do **NOT** have 2FA: GitHub will accept your username and password.
  * If you **do** have 2FA (two-factor), you must use a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your password. Create it in GitHub Settings ‚Üí Developer settings ‚Üí Personal access tokens ‚Üí Tokens (classic) or fine-grained tokens. Give `repo` scope for classic token (or appropriate access for fine-grained).
* When prompted for password, paste the token (it will look like a long string). On Git Bash, username is your GitHub username; password is the token.

If push succeeds you‚Äôll see:

```
Counting objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3),  ... 
To https://github.com/...
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

---

# 4B) Push via SSH (recommended if you‚Äôll push often)

If you prefer SSH (one-time setup), do:

## Generate SSH key (if you don't have one)

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your.email@example.com"
# If asked for a filename, accept default. Enter a passphrase or leave empty.
```

If system doesn't support ed25519, use rsa:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your.email@example.com"
```

## Add SSH key to ssh-agent

```bash
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519    # or ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Copy public key and add to GitHub

```bash
# print it
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
```

Copy entire output, then in GitHub go to **Settings ‚Üí SSH and GPG keys ‚Üí New SSH key**, paste and save.

## Use SSH remote and push

On local repo:

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/hello-java.git
git push -u origin main
```

If SSH works, you'll see something like:

```
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3),  ... 
To github.com:your-username/hello-java.git
 * [new branch]      main -> main
Branch 'main' set up to track 'origin/main'.
```

If you see `Permission denied (publickey)`, check the SSH key steps: ensure the public key was added to GitHub and the ssh-agent has the private key loaded.

---

# 5) If the GitHub repo was created *with* a README (you see `remote: error: failed to push some refs`):

This means the remote has commits and you must pull first or force push. Recommended safe way:

```bash
# fetch remote and merge
git pull --rebase origin main
# resolve any conflicts (should be none if only README exists)
git push -u origin main
```

If you are certain remote has only README and you want to overwrite, you could do:

```bash
git push -u origin main --force
```

(Only do `--force` if you understand it rewrites remote history.)

---

# 6) Verify on GitHub

Open your repository page `https://github.com/<your-username>/hello-java`
You should see `HelloWorld.java` and the commit message visible under **Commits** or file view.

---

# 7) Extra: compile & run the Java file locally (optional)

If Java is installed:

```bash
javac HelloWorld.java
java HelloWorld
```

Output should be:

```
Hello, world!
```

---
Q2. (15 Marks) 
Create a simple Maven project using the command line and build it using mvn clean package. 
Expected Output: Successful build with .jar file in target folder.

# Troubleshooting cheatsheet

* `git: command not found` ‚Üí install Git (on Windows install Git for Windows; on Ubuntu `sudo apt install git`).
* `Permission denied (publickey)` ‚Üí SSH key not added or ssh-agent not running. Re-run key setup and add key to GitHub.
* `remote: Invalid username or password` ‚Üí using password with 2FA ‚Äî use PAT instead.
* `error: failed to push some refs` ‚Üí remote has commits; run `git pull --rebase origin main` then push.

---

# Full example session (copy-paste)

Replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username.

```bash
# create folder & file
mkdir ~/hello-java && cd ~/hello-java
cat > HelloWorld.java <<'EOF'
public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    }
}
EOF

# git setup & commit
git init
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
git add HelloWorld.java
git commit -m "Add HelloWorld.java"
git branch -M main

# add remote and push (HTTPS)
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/hello-java.git
git push -u origin main
```

Or (if using SSH, after creating SSH key and adding to GitHub):

```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:<your-username>/hello-java.git
git push -u origin main
```

---

# Final checklist to hand in / show your professor

* [ ] GitHub repo link (e.g. `https://github.com/<your-username>/hello-java`)
* [ ] `HelloWorld.java` visible in repo
* [ ] Commit message visible (e.g., `Add HelloWorld.java`)
* [ ] (Optional) Screenshot of terminal showing `git commit` and `git push` output

Perfect üëç ‚Äî this is another **hands-on practical DevOps/Java build question**.
Let‚Äôs go **step-by-step** so you can perform it easily on your college PC and get the **expected output: successful .jar file inside the `target` folder**.

---

## ‚úÖ **Q2. Create a simple Maven project using the command line and build it using `mvn clean package`**

---

## üß© **Goal**

You will:

1. Create a new Maven project from the terminal.
2. Add a simple Java program.
3. Build the project using Maven.
4. Confirm that a `.jar` file is created inside the `target` folder.

---

## üß∞ **Pre-requisites**

Make sure:

* Java and Maven are installed.

Check versions:

```bash
java -version
mvn -version
```

‚úÖ If both commands show version info ‚Üí you‚Äôre good.
‚ùå If not, ask the lab instructor to install them or set `JAVA_HOME` / `MAVEN_HOME`.

---

## ü™ú **Step-by-Step Procedure**

### **Step 1: Open Terminal (or Git Bash / CMD)**

Choose a working directory, e.g. Desktop or home folder:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

---

### **Step 2: Create a simple Maven project using the archetype command**

Run this command:

```bash
mvn archetype:generate -DgroupId=com.example \
-DartifactId=MyApp \
-DarchetypeArtifactId=maven-archetype-quickstart \
-DinteractiveMode=false
```

**Explanation:**

* `groupId`: your project‚Äôs package name (like a company domain)
* `artifactId`: project name
* `maven-archetype-quickstart`: template for basic Java app
* `-DinteractiveMode=false`: runs automatically (no prompts)

---

### **Step 3: Go into your new project**

```bash
cd MyApp
```

Inside, you‚Äôll have this structure:

```
MyApp/
 ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pom.xml
 ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
     ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main/java/com/example/App.java
     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test/java/com/example/AppTest.java
```

---

### **Step 4: Open and check your Java code**

You can check the main Java file:

```bash
cat src/main/java/com/example/App.java
```

You‚Äôll see something like:

```java
package com.example;

public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```

You can modify it if needed ‚Äî for example:

```java
System.out.println("Hello from Maven project!");
```

---

### **Step 5: Build the project**

Now build using Maven commands:

#### a) Clean old builds

```bash
mvn clean
```

#### b) Package (compile + test + create jar)

```bash
mvn package
```

‚úÖ **Expected Output:**
At the end, you should see:

```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

and inside the `target` folder:

```
target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

### **Step 6: Verify the `.jar` file**

List the target folder:

```bash
ls target
```

Expected files:

```
classes/
test-classes/
MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

---

### **Step 7: Run the jar (optional)**

You can test it using Java:

```bash
java -cp target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar com.example.App
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Hello from Maven project!
```

---

## üßæ **Expected Output (for submission / screenshot)**

When you run:

```bash
mvn clean package
```

You should capture output similar to:

```
[INFO] Scanning for projects...
[INFO] Building MyApp 1.0-SNAPSHOT
[INFO] Compiling 1 source file to /MyApp/target/classes
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

and `target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar` must be visible.

---

## üß† **Concept Behind the Question**

* **Maven** is a build automation tool for Java.
* **`pom.xml`** is the project descriptor.
* **`mvn clean`** ‚Üí removes old build files.
* **`mvn package`** ‚Üí compiles source + runs tests + packages output as a `.jar`.

---

Q3. (10 Marks) 
Create a Dockerfile for your Maven project and build a Docker image using the command line. 
Expected Output: Docker image visible in docker images. 
Perfect! This is the **Docker hands-on question** ‚Äî we‚Äôll take your Maven project from **Q2** and containerize it step by step. I‚Äôll make it **very detailed** so you can perform it on your college PC.

---

# ‚úÖ **Q3. Dockerize Maven Project**

**Goal:**

* Create a Dockerfile for the Maven project (`MyApp`)
* Build a Docker image
* Verify the image is created with `docker images`

---

## üß∞ **Prerequisites**

1. Docker installed: Check:

```bash
docker --version
```

2. Your Maven project is ready (`MyApp`) and built successfully (`target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar`)
3. Terminal or PowerShell access

---

## ü™ú **Step 1: Go to your project folder**

```bash
cd ~/Desktop/MyApp
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 2: Create a Dockerfile**

Create a file named `Dockerfile` (no extension):

```bash
touch Dockerfile
```

Open it in an editor (`nano Dockerfile`) or directly write:

```bash
cat > Dockerfile <<'EOF'
# Step 1: Use official OpenJDK image
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim

# Step 2: Set working directory inside container
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the jar file from target folder to container
COPY target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar

# Step 4: Command to run the jar
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
EOF
```

**Explanation of Dockerfile:**

| Step | Command                                      | Purpose                           |
| ---- | -------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| 1    | `FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim`                   | Base image with Java 17           |
| 2    | `WORKDIR /app`                               | Directory inside container        |
| 3    | `COPY target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar` | Copy your built jar               |
| 4    | `ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]`       | Run the jar when container starts |

---

## ü™ú **Step 3: Build the Docker image**

Run:

```bash
docker build -t myapp-image .
```

**Explanation:**

* `-t myapp-image` ‚Üí tag name for the image
* `.` ‚Üí current directory (Dockerfile location)

‚úÖ Expected Output (partial):

```
Sending build context to Docker daemon  5.12MB
Step 1/4 : FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
 ---> ...
Step 2/4 : WORKDIR /app
 ---> Using cache
Step 3/4 : COPY target/MyApp-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
 ---> ...
Step 4/4 : ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","app.jar"]
 ---> ...
Successfully built abcdef123456
Successfully tagged myapp-image:latest
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 4: Verify the Docker image**

```bash
docker images
```

You should see:

```
REPOSITORY      TAG       IMAGE ID       CREATED          SIZE
myapp-image     latest    abcdef123456   10 seconds ago   120MB
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 5: Run the Docker container (optional test)**

```bash
docker run --rm myapp-image
```

Expected output:

```
Hello from Maven project!
```

> `--rm` removes the container after it stops

---

## üß† **Concept Behind This Question**

* Docker allows you to **package your Java app + runtime** in a container.
* `Dockerfile` defines how to build the image: base image ‚Üí copy app ‚Üí run app.
* `docker build` ‚Üí creates an image
* `docker images` ‚Üí lists all local images
* `docker run` ‚Üí runs the app inside a container

## ü™ú **Step 7: Optional Post-build Steps**

* **Archive the artifacts**:

  * Post-build action ‚Üí **Archive the artifacts**
  * Enter: `target/*.jar`
  * This allows you to download the `.jar` from Jenkins.

---

## üß† **Concept Behind This Question**

* Jenkins is a **Continuous Integration tool**
* Freestyle project is the simplest Jenkins job type
* **Git** plugin pulls the code
* **Maven build step** compiles, tests, and packages the Java app
* Successful build shows Jenkins can automate the Maven build process

---
Q2. (15 Marks) 
Configure Jenkins to automatically trigger a build whenever new code is pushed to GitHub using 
a webhook. 
Expected Output: Jenkins job triggers automatically on every commit.
Perfect! This is the **GitHub webhook CI/CD automation question**. I‚Äôll guide you step by step to **configure Jenkins so it triggers a build automatically whenever code is pushed to GitHub**.

---

# ‚úÖ **Q2 (Set 2): Jenkins Automatic Build Trigger via GitHub Webhook**

**Goal:**

* Configure Jenkins to poll GitHub for changes using a webhook
* Whenever a commit is pushed to GitHub, Jenkins automatically builds the job

---

## üß∞ **Prerequisites**

1. Jenkins running and accessible from a browser

   * If local: `http://localhost:8080`
   * If on college network: Jenkins should be accessible externally or via local tunnel (e.g., **ngrok**)
2. Jenkins job exists (`MyApp-Build`)
3. GitHub repository exists and contains your project
4. GitHub plugin installed in Jenkins

---

## ü™ú **Step 1: Configure Jenkins Job to Build Remotely**

1. Go to your Jenkins job ‚Üí **Configure**
2. Scroll to **Build Triggers** ‚Üí select **GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling**

   * This allows Jenkins to listen for GitHub webhook events

---

## ü™ú **Step 2: Make Jenkins Accessible to GitHub**

* GitHub needs to reach Jenkins over the internet. If Jenkins is local (localhost), GitHub cannot access it. Use **ngrok** to create a public URL:

```bash
# start ngrok on port 8080 (where Jenkins runs)
ngrok http 8080
```

* Copy the **Forwarding URL** (e.g., `https://abcd1234.ngrok.io`)

---

## ü™ú **Step 3: Configure GitHub Webhook**

1. Go to your GitHub repository ‚Üí **Settings ‚Üí Webhooks ‚Üí Add webhook**
2. Fill in:

   * **Payload URL:** `https://<your-ngrok-id>.ngrok.io/github-webhook/`

     * `/github-webhook/` is required for the GitHub plugin in Jenkins
   * **Content type:** `application/json`
   * **Which events would you like to trigger this webhook?** ‚Üí Select **Just the push event**
3. Click **Add webhook**

‚úÖ GitHub will send a test ping ‚Üí Jenkins should receive it (check Jenkins logs: **Manage Jenkins ‚Üí System Log**)

---

## ü™ú **Step 4: Save Jenkins Job Configuration**

* Click **Save** in Jenkins
* Ensure **Build Triggers ‚Üí GitHub hook trigger** is checked

---

## ü™ú **Step 5: Test the Automatic Trigger**

1. Make a small change in your project (e.g., update `HelloWorld.java`)
2. Commit and push to GitHub:

```bash
git add HelloWorld.java
git commit -m "Test automatic build trigger"
git push origin main
```

3. Go to Jenkins ‚Üí Job `MyApp-Build`
4. You should see a **new build triggered automatically**
5. Console output should show Maven build:

```
[INFO] BUILD SUCCESS
```

---

## üß† **Concept Behind This Question**

* **GitHub Webhook:** Sends an HTTP POST to Jenkins whenever an event happens (push in this case)
* **Jenkins GitHub Plugin:** Listens for webhook events and triggers builds
* **CI/CD Benefit:** Builds happen automatically on every commit ‚Üí fast feedback loop

Q3. (10 Marks) 
Run a container from a Docker image and verify it using docker ps and container logs. 
Expected Output: Container running successfully with correct output. 
Perfect! This question is about **running your Dockerized Maven project (from Q3 Set 1)** and verifying that it works. I‚Äôll give you a **step-by-step detailed answer**.

---

# ‚úÖ **Q3 (Set 2): Run Docker Container and Verify**

**Goal:**

* Run a container from your Docker image (`myapp-image`)
* Verify it is running with `docker ps`
* Check container logs to confirm output

---

## üß∞ **Prerequisites**

1. Docker installed and running:

```bash
docker --version
```

2. Docker image already built from Q3 Set 1 (`myapp-image`)
3. Terminal access

---

## ü™ú **Step 1: Run the Docker Container**

```bash
docker run -d --name myapp-container myapp-image
```

**Explanation:**

| Option                   | Purpose                                        |
| ------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `-d`                     | Run container in detached mode (in background) |
| `--name myapp-container` | Give a friendly name to the container          |
| `myapp-image`            | Docker image name to run                       |

‚úÖ Output: Docker will return a long **container ID**, e.g.,

```
a1b2c3d4e5f6g7h8i9j0
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 2: Verify Container is Running**

```bash
docker ps
```

Expected output:

```
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE          COMMAND                  STATUS          PORTS   NAMES
a1b2c3d4e5f6   myapp-image    "java -jar app.jar"      Up 5 seconds           myapp-container
```

* **STATUS:** should show `Up` ‚Üí container is running
* **NAMES:** should match the name you gave (`myapp-container`)

---

## ü™ú **Step 3: Check Container Logs**

```bash
docker logs myapp-container
```

Expected output (from your Java program):

```
Hello from Maven project!
```

* This confirms that the Java program inside the container is running correctly.

---

## ü™ú **Step 4: Stop and Remove Container (optional)**

After verification:

```bash
docker stop myapp-container
docker rm myapp-container
```

* Stops and deletes the container to free resources

---

## üß† **Concept Behind This Question**

* `docker run` ‚Üí launches a container from an image
* `docker ps` ‚Üí lists all running containers
* `docker logs` ‚Üí shows stdout/stderr logs from the container
* Ensures that the Docker image works correctly in an isolated environment

---

Clone your GitHub repository, modify one Java file, commit and push the changes. 
Expected Output: Updated code with new commit visible on GitHub. 

Perfect! This is a **basic Git workflow question**. I‚Äôll give you a **detailed step-by-step procedure** so you can perform it easily on your college PC.

---

# ‚úÖ **Q1 (Set 3): Clone, Modify, Commit, and Push**

**Goal:**

* Clone your GitHub repo
* Modify a Java file
* Commit the changes
* Push to GitHub
* Confirm the new commit appears on GitHub

---

## üß∞ **Prerequisites**

1. Git installed on your PC:

```bash
git --version
```

2. GitHub repository exists (e.g., `MyApp`)
3. Terminal / Git Bash / PowerShell access

---

## ü™ú **Step 1: Clone the GitHub Repository**

Go to the folder where you want to store the repo:

```bash
cd ~/Desktop
```

Clone using HTTPS or SSH:

**HTTPS:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/MyApp.git
```

**SSH:**

```bash
git clone git@github.com:<username>/MyApp.git
```

* Replace `<username>` with your GitHub username.
* After cloning, a folder `MyApp` is created.

Go into the project folder:

```bash
cd MyApp
```

Check files:

```bash
ls
```

You should see `pom.xml`, `src/`, etc.

## ü™ú **Step 2: Modify a Java File**

Open a Java file (e.g., `HelloWorld.java`) for editing:

```bash
nano src/main/java/com/example/App.java
```

Add a new line or change the print message:

```java
System.out.println("This is a modified version!");
```

Save and exit (`Ctrl+O`, `Enter`, `Ctrl+X` in nano).

---

## ü™ú **Step 3: Stage the Changes**

Check the status:

```bash
git status
```

You should see something like:

```
modified: src/main/java/com/example/App.java
```

Stage the changes:

```bash
git add src/main/java/com/example/App.java
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 4: Commit the Changes**

echo "Hello World - Version 1" > hello.txt
```

Check status:

```bash
git status
```

Stage the file:

```bash
git add hello.txt
```

Commit the first version:

```bash
git commit -m "Add hello.txt version 1"
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
[main (root-commit) abc1234] Add hello.txt version 1
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 hello.txt
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 3: Modify the File (Version 2)**

Edit the file:

```bash
echo "Hello World - Version 2" >> hello.txt
```

Check status:

```bash
git status
```

Stage the change:

```bash
git add hello.txt
```

Commit the second version:

```bash
git commit -m "Update hello.txt to version 2"
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
[main def5678] Update hello.txt to version 2
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
```

## ü™ú **Step 4: Create GitHub Repository**

1. Go to [https://github.com](https://github.com) ‚Üí **New Repository**
2. Name it `MyGitProject`
3. Keep it **public** or **private**
4. **Do not initialize with README**

---

## ü™ú **Step 5: Link Local Repo to GitHub**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<username>/MyGitProject.git
```

Push commits:

```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

‚úÖ Output:

```
Enumerating objects: 3, done.
Counting objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Writing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
Total 3 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0)
To https://github.com/<username>/MyGitProject.git
   abc1234..def5678  main -> main
```

---

## ü™ú **Step 6: Verify on GitHub**

1. Go to your GitHub repository:
   `https://github.com/<username>/MyGitProject`
2. Click **Commits** ‚Üí you should see:

   * `Add hello.txt version 1`
   * `Update hello.txt to version 2`

‚úÖ This shows **multiple versions of the same file**

## üß† **Concept Behind This Question**

* **Git version control** tracks changes to files over time
* Each commit represents a **snapshot of the project**
* Multiple commits show **progression/version history**
* `git push` syncs your local repository with **remote GitHub repository**
